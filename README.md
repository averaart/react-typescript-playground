# Quickstart for React

Mostly a combination of the [React and Webpack](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html0) example on the TypeScript website and [instructions by Robin Rendle](https://gist.github.com/robinrendle/0bb0b9e55fafa1cc0c64ff4b5776df050).

- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start`
- Chrome will open, load `index.html` and will reload after any compile

## Todo

- figure out if there's any actual difference between `yarn dev` and `yarn start`, as they both seem to compile and reload on changes.
